        <item>Balmond is the leader of the Orcs, leading the Orc army against the invasion of the Demons. During a battle, he consumed the blood of a Blood Demon and went into a rage. This aroused Alice\'s interest, so she signed a contract with Balmond on the condition of returning the Stormeye Wasteland. Balmond, and his Orc army have since fought for the Demons.\n\nDespite all this, it seemed fate had not yet finished toying with this ancient race. As the Abyss encroach once more powerful demons emerged again from the south presenting a perilous threat to their declining Orc populations. Under the demons oppression the Orcs were made to split into several small clans scattered throughout the vast expanse of the roaring wilderness, exploited to the utmost.\n\nBalmond was born in a traditional orc tribe within the Roaring Wilderness, and from a young age his father had always taught him all kinds of combat skills. Along with this, he would also regale him tiles of the Orcs former glories; how they once resided in their homeland in the north of Lantis Mountains and their millennia of fierce battles waged against the elves and humans. He hoped that Balmond would, one day, be able to become a true Orc leader and return them to their former glory.\n\nOver twenty years later, Balmond had grown into a mighty Orc under his fathers teaching. And during this time, the demons brutality had instilled Balmond with deep, dark memories, only making him yearn even more for the day when the Orcs could return to power, bringing back their formidable kingdom.

        <item>In the east of the Land of Dawn, between the old village Stream Valley and the Scarlet Shadow, a huge totem ruin stands among the mountains and forests. Some believe that it symbolizes a kind of faith or, as an oracle claimed, is guarding the land. Not far from it, there are mysterious stone steps covered by some leaves. The winding stone steps reach to the sky. Its destination is the Land of Xuao, also known as the Land of Mystic Tortoise.\n\nIn a hundred-mile radius, the stone land is fringed by a cloud forest with an enormous shadow sitting in the center. It seems that he is cultivating himself. Meditation makes one keep away from disputes. However, the cloud begins to grow gloomy. There is a feeling of tension in the air. Suddenly, dozens of chains penetrate the clouds and some assassins land on the stone land. There is a word on their masks, Cyan. They want to lock Baxia with their chains. Fortunately, with the protection of his steel shield made with black ore, Baxia can safely release his power. Those assassins are beaten down, moaning in anguish. However, when one of these assassins mentions Cyan Finch, Baxia is astonished. He knows that it is the name of the best assassin of the Cadia Riverlands and how powerful he is. He knows that Cyan Finch is on his way to kill the Great Dragon. Baxia realizes that he must make an important decision now. This causes him to recall the unforgettable war that occurred hundreds of years ago.</item>
        <item>A year and a half ago, the Scholars Union of Eruditio welcomed a new student into their ranks. Unlike the other newcomers, this young girl named Beatrix seemed to possess profound knowledge of and astonishing talent for science. Before long she stood head and shoulders above her peers, becoming one of the most promising scholars of the entire Scholars Union. Even Dr. Rooney, who was watching her quietly from afar, was impressed by her progress. He believed that, if she were to apply herself to her studies, Beatrix could one day become the greatest scientist Eruditio had ever seen. \n\n Yet becoming the best scientist was not something Beatrix placed any great importance in. She was born in Castle Gorge in the Moniyan Empire, to a family of merchants. For generations, her family had already been well established as a wealthy merchant family business in the empire. In order to maintain their huge trade network, Beatrix parents often had little choice but to travel all around the Land of Dawn on business, leaving the young Beatrix in the care of their loyal butler, Morgan. \n\n With the endowed means and liberty granted by her family, Beatrix spent her spirited childhood under Morgan doting care. As such, she gained a penchant for mischief, and became a stubborn and often capricious individual. One day, Beatrix parents returned from the far west, bringing along with them a range of advanced gadgets from Eruditio to give her. Beatrix had long grown tired of the mundane and uninteresting toys that surrounded her, and so she began to obsess over these novelties. They sparked within her a deep interest in technology itself. In the several years that followed, Morgan would regularly shuttle between Eruditio and Castle Gorge to bring Beatrix the latest inventions, which proved to be an extremely expensive endeavor. As she tirelessly studied them, Beatrix began to nurture within herself an incredible natural talent for science. She digested many complex mechanical concepts and structures as if they were childs play.</item>
        <item>Chou is a gifted martial artist born in the slums. He learned the ancient oriental martial arts under the tutelage of a mysterious monk. He is agile and skilled in the use of the nunchaku.\n\nChou was born in a secluded slum deep in the hearts of poverty, living the lowest quality of life. Despite the dreadful conditions, Chou kept his heart of kindness, as day in and day out he continued to look after the old and the young there with passion. During this time, there was great turmoil and unrest in the Land of the Dawn mayhem spread throughout the land and eventually started to affect this small remote area.\n\nOne day, Chou rescued a mystic monk under pursuit by his captors and took him back to his slum to care for him. In return, the monk imparted the ancient Asian Kung-Fu skill to Chou and told him that the world needed a real hero to stand up and end the chaos.

        <item>Created by the Ancient Ones, Edith was the Primal Warden that watched over the sealed Evil Gods on the Sanctum Island. Awakened and injured in an earthquake, she lost her memories and was saved by her foster father who made a living by selling scraps and continued to raise her for ten years. When she once again helped her foster father enter the temple to search for scraps, the guardian of the ruins-Elemental Giant Uranus was prepared to destroy the invaders. It was then that Edith remembered everything, but her humanity overpowered her divine nature, and she fought Uranus to protect her foster father. Just then, the Celestial Palace fell and the sealed Evil Gods scattered. Edith parted with her foster father, drove her Mecha Phylax and set out on a journey to hunt down fleeing Evil Gods.\n\n In the far distant past when the world was just created, Ancient Ones built the Celestial Palace above the Sanctum Island in the Sea of Hope.\n\n Remote and undisturbed, the island was the ideal location for Ancient wonders. The Ancient Ones set out to build temples and workshops with their incredible skills and technologies. When the Celestial Palace began functioning, the mechanisms of the temple on the island received energy waves from the palace, and thus the island on the ground started coordinating with the palace above the sky.The island was a part of a submarine volcano. Submerged rocks and atolls were strewn all over the vicinity of the island, and the waters nearby are often shrouded in dense sea fog, which caused the wreckage of many ships that ventured to pass by. </item>
        <item>Faramis came from a long line of physicians. With the ancestral staff passed down the family, his grandfather combined magic and medicine and developed cures for many once-incurable diseases. The feat earned the gifted physician a title from the Moniyan Empire, and the family had since served the royalties as their personal physicians.\n\n None of these proved adequate to earn the family respect from their equals, though. The other nobles viewed them as mere servants with some special medical skills, while young Faramis, for this reason, was often bullied and ridiculed by his peers.\n\n At a banquet, the boys struck again, and poor Faramis was left fainted on the ground of the back garden. When he regained consciousness, he saw a highborn girl half-knelt by his side, giving him medicine. That was the only time young Faramis had received kindness from his peers. The encounter, despite being brief, was like a ray of sunshine into his gloomy life.\n\n Frail and sickly from birth, Faramis had brushed with death numerous times and survived only because of his parents meticulous treatment. After many near-death experiences, he vowed to conquer death and take life into his own hands and was reluctant to serve the royalties as his family did.\n\n He found the royalties minor ailments extremely boring and wanted nothing to do with those hypocritical nobles. He yearned to challenge complex, intractable diseases to bring his skills to heights no other physicians had ever reached before.  </item>
        <item>The Abyss grew in power, thrusting the Land of Dawn once more into the thick mists of eternal war. It was a true calamity that spread suffering throughout the Land of Dawn. Especially the Moniyan Empires southern frontier. The creeping threat and corruption of the Abyss plunged this place into ruins and it stands now as a barren wilderness.\n\n The Empire had long since ceased even trying to reclaim these lands, and the numbers of those fleeing to the Moniyan heartlands for a new life grew by the day. Those unwilling to leave their homeland remained behind and strived to make ends meet, yet they failed to unite and provide a resistance to the advancing Abyss. Instead, they embraced brute force and violence in their toils to stake their claim to the lands dwindling resources. Conflict ruled over all.\n\n Like the distant Land of Despair, this frontier fell into a deep decay, a pit without the faintest ray of hope. Until that day came. A man with a peculiar scar across his back and fists of iron wandered these chaotic lands purging the injustice and cruelty that dominated it. A long-lost warmth returned to the peoples hearts as one malicious force after another fell before him.Nobody knew from whence this man had [come]. And so, those he had saved would simply refer to him as the Heavenly Fist. Yet his name was Paquito.\n\n Paquito was born in a small village in southwestern Moniyan. To survive and prosper in a land like this so far from the royal capital, you had to be strong. And so he had but one dream since he was a little boy To become the worlds strongest fighter. Paquito tempered his mind, his body and spirit through any and every means possible in his quest for this power.</item>
        <item>The Crow people of Askati Forest are one of the oldest races to still exist in the Land of Dawn. This race was united by the Crow King, Osana, under whose venerable leadership they perfected the art of Sky Magic.This unique school of magic allows its wielder to transform into a bird, soar across the skies, and grants the ability to strike from enormous distances, however, only those who have had their blood awakened can use it. The noble Princess Pharsa was born with an unknown type of blood which was said to hold enormous potential if awakened, but as hard as they tried, the baffled people of her tribe failed to unleash its true power. Soon enough, Pharsas special blood became a burden, as ill-intentioned opportunists from across the land sought to reap it for their own benefit. On the day of Pharsa wedding, the tyrannical witch, Alice Alice invaded the Askati Forest, mercilessly slaying countless Crows and leaving a smoldering trail of ruin in her wake. Numbed to the core by the carnage surrounding her, Pharsa dropped Osanas ancient crown to the floor. Her appearance began to change, as unprecedented power coursed through her veins her blood had been awakened. Pharsas eyes clouded over, as one side of her hair turned pure white, and she soared into the sky to unleash a torrential assault of horrifying magical power, fierce enough to drive Alice Alice away. Verri, the love of her life, couldnt bear to see his betrothed suffer a life of blindness alone, and chose to accompany Pharsa wherever she went, utilizing his own magic to become permanently linked to Pharsa, and allowing her to see through his eyes. Pharsa wishes her power had never been awakened, she wishes even more that her home had not been destroyed, but that witch took everything from her, and now it was time for revenge.</item>
        <item>The once-reversed master craftsman was now known as the notorious Executioner of the Abyss, but Terizla didnt care. From the moment he was framed as heretic by the Church, he had been wielding his hammer solely for revenge, for the day he could at last soothe the restless souls of his kin.\n\n As one of the most powerful institutions in the Land of Dawn, the inquisition of the Monastery of Light evoked both extreme reverence and absolute dread from its people. The very thought of having to traverse its hallowed halls and cryptic depths would send an involuntary shudder even among the most devout followers of Light. For at the very depths of this solemn place was the Gate of Rebirth, the dungeon holding the Church deepest secret a past so dark it could leave even the bravest of souls petrified in fear.\n\n Ten years ago, deep in the dungeons of the inquisition, a guard slowly unlocked an iron gate to check on the imprisoned victim, only to find it completely abandoned. The dark and desolate cell lay empty, except for a bloody message that stained its unforgiving walls. Heavy with hatred. \n\n As head of the Free Smiths Guild and spiritual leader of the anti-Church alliance in Lumina City, Terizla repeatedly ignored the Church commandments while openly advocating for fellow smiths sanctioned by the Church. His blatant defiance of the Monasterys teachings earned him both the disfavor of the Church and the label of Lumina City.</item>
        <item>In a battle against the Abyss invasion, Valentina and her lover, Irlan, were betrayed by some members of House Paxley, which eventually caused Irlan to lose his soul. To revive her lover, Valentina made a deal with an Evil God and gained immortality in the power of shadow. Since then, she did been hiding among the shadows, silently waiting for the appearance of the Heart of Anima a broken piece from the Twilight Orb that was said to be the key to retrieving her lovers soul.\n\n House Paxley ruled over the regions near the Lantis Mountains in the south of the Moniyan Empire. Generations of the house had guarded these areas for the Empire, defending against the invasion of the Abyss with magic and swords. As the house patriarchs eldest daughter, Valentina had been given high hopes since she was born. She underwent rigorous training and grew up into a proud perfectionist, the heir most qualified to lead this noble house. As she grew older, she went to the frontier and helped the house repel wave after wave of invading demons. The news of victories in Lantis Mountains became the only thing that could put the civilians minds at ease. As a result, House Paxley rose quickly among the nobles, while Valentina became the youngest and only female member of the house council. \n\n House Paxley ruled over the regions near the Lantis Mountains in the south of the Moniyan Empire.

        <item>In the south of the Cadia Riverlands lies a picturesque land where the civilization of Ba and Shu lived. The Land of Abundance was what the natives called this place. Tangmen, a faction that was known for their hidden weapons and skilled craft, originated from this land. However, Tangmen new leader found out that many people often used Tangmen crafts and hidden weapons to do evil, which was running against his will. Because of that, he decided to disband his faction and exiled himself to the forest, in a place of solitude with his daughter.\n\n Since birth, Wanwan lived together with her father. The forest was her home and she spent a lot of time hunting and training there. On her fifth birthday, her father gave her a set of needles as a birthday gift that was made from a particular silver found at the bottom of the sea. That day, he also revealed the history of the Tangmen to her. This set of needles was a valuable and secret weapon created by Tangmen, which consisted of a total of 81 needles. \n\n Tangmen skilled craft forged the needles into a lethal weapon, killing anyone who dared to challenge its power. Wanwan father told her to use the weapon only if she was in danger. That the first lesson her father taught her. One day, Wanwan and her father found Black Dragon at the bottom of a cliff. It is the first time that Wanwan saw a person who was injured so badly, and she couldnt bear to leave him alone. With the help of her father, she carried the Black Dragon to their home and took care of him. The Black Dragon was moved by this kind-hearted girl and opened his mind to her. \n\n He spent many hours with the young girl, telling her his story, his dream, and his ambition, teaching her how to become more powerful. However, the Black Dragon left Wanwan a few months later without leaving any word, which made Wanwan sad for a long time. Ten years later, Wanwan grew up. Her skills with the darts became more pronounced, being able to split a drop of dew a hundred steps away into 2 with just a single dart. Her father told her not to show her formidable skills to others and to keep away from trouble. But Wanwan was too curious, and she wanted to travel the world. On the day Wanwan started her journey, her father gave her the most precious craft of Tangmen the Crossbow of Tang, which could launch a rain of arrows to attack the enemy, and its power could scale along with the power of the handler.</item>
        <item>Xavier was a member of the Knights of Light who was awarded the title Arbiter of Light. After suppressing Terizla Free Smiths Guild, Xavier underwent a decade of inner struggle and despondency. And when he was ordered to capture the two heretics, Yin and Melissa, he was once again forced to choose between duty and conscience.\n\n Xavier was a glorious member of the Knights of Light a force that rivaled the Lights Order of the Moniyan Empire. Besides being the youngest Arbiter of Light, he was also known for his unusual quirks. \n\n Xavier was born into an ordinary merchant family in Lumina City. The only thing unusual, if there was any, was his mother a Light Elf. Probably due to his Elf lineage, Xavier was born with extraordinary intelligence and eyes the color of the purest sapphire. Xaviers father once had high hopes for Xavier, thinking he could bring a fortune to his business. Xavier, however, showed zero interest in the family business and joined the Monastery of Light the moment he came of age. Before he left, his mother, who also believed in the King of Light, gave him a magic cloak crafted by the Elves. To the followers of Light, the Monastery of Light was the sacred place that they did sacrifice everything to be a part of, but only very few of them could pass the harsh, if not impossible, entry tests. That wasn not the case for Xavier, and the reason could be traced back to when he was a child.</item>
        <item>Yin was an orphan found and raised by locals of Floral Falls. In an unfortunate incident, he ran into the fleeting Evil God, Lieh and have since become the latter a vessel. Although he did managed to regain control of his body, there was always the risk of the Evil God would break loose and wreak havoc up on everything he came into contact with. To protect his loved ones and hometown he embarked on the journey to Moniyan Empire alone in seeking a cure. \n\n Among the emerald mountains that stretched hundreds of miles near Dragon Altar lay Floral Falls, a serene valley where peach trees grew in every corner and petals fell gracefully like snowflakes whenever a breeze blew past. People who lived there practiced the ancient oriental martial arts and were called martial artists by others in Cadia Riverlands.\n\n In an early morning seventeen years ago, a baby boy drifted in a basket down the river to Floral Falls and was found and adopted by a local. He was named Yin after the earthly branch for the Year of the Tiger the year he was found. Ten years quickly passed by, and Yin grew up into a young boy training in martial arts. He seemed scrawny but had unexpectedly powerful strength, and the elder martial artists in the valley thought of him as a martial arts genius gifted to them by the heavens.</item>
        <item>Aurora was the first person to discover Yve. This was the first time such a mysterious, cold, and emotionless creature had appeared in the Land of Dawn. Massive energy fluctuations came from the time rift. Aurora thought that Zhask had returned and that she would finally have the chance to avenge her beloved. But as it turned out, she saw someone who seemed to be even more powerful.\n\n Yve came down from the sky above the Frozen Ocean. She considered everything and everyone beneath her notice and was only interested in finding Zhask. Her instincts told her that her old nemesis had once appeared here. Yve simply glanced at Aurora with indifference, then turned and left. Just as Aurora was hesitating about whether to chase down this mysterious visitor, Yve released an explosion of tremendous energy, closing the time rift temporarily. She then turned and left.\n\n This time rift has torn open by Yve has existed for thousands of years since the Ancient Ones triggered the great explosion using the Twilight Orb. Nobody can get near it, and nobody knows where it leads. Only Aurora watches it closely at all times, waiting to take revenge on her nemesis Zhask for her lover Tobias. Aurora clearly understands what sort of powerful energy it would take to close the time rift For this reason, she has had a premonition Perhaps both Zhask and Tobias are coming back.\n\n Yve comes from Mithlora, a mysterious region of the galaxy. Her people are few in number but possess immense strength. However, they also have an arch enemy the Swarm. As some of the most proficient hunters in the universe who are born with great power, Yve race must find and deal with the Swarm wherever they appear.
